'cause you woke up in the mornin'
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
(Don't hold back) if you think about it, so many people do
Be cool man, look smarter
and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
(Don't hold back) 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care
(Don't hold back)
World (you're holding back)
The time has come to
World (you're holding back)
The time has come to
World (you're holding back)
The time has come to
Galvanize
Come on, come on, come on
if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
(Don't hold back) you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
